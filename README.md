# What is this?
A small set of solutions to project Euler problems in c, java, and python
# Why is it in three different languages?
Because I think in three different languages. I'm most comfortable with Java, but I'm starting to think in Python. Sometimes a problem screams C.

# What is Project Euler?
(From the website)
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
